# Modifications to enable coumpound bookings

We provide one implementation where compound-bookings are handled one by one where conflicts in compounds (e. g. room & room)
not allowed, so that all parts of the compound can be tackled concurrently and one where also conflicts in compounds are allowed
and the compound is worked through consecutively (reservations.legacy).

In both cases in the all parts of the compound are checked and the appropriate
actions collected along the way. These actions are only excecuted if all of them are possible.
The VIP system is still in place and overwrites of non-VIPs and the corresponding notifications
are only done, if the whole compound the VIP wants to book is bookable.

Compounds are the default and single bookings are done as compounds with only one booking.

When the non-VIP user is overwritten by a VIP in a booking of a compound, the rest of the compound
is also deleted (implementation: each booking contains a reference to its compound).
