# Priority system

Again for a given request from some user to some facility, the overlaps to existing timeframes are counted
and compared to the number of instances of the resource. In addition, now
the number of VIP requests is counted separately. If a VIP request comes in
and there is an overlap with a non-VIP booking, the non-VIP booking is
cancelled, the respective user notified and the VIP request is processed.
VIPs cannot cancel each other.

Different facilities can be booked concurrently.
